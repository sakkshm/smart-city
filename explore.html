		<h2>Singapore</h2>
		<p>
			Topping most lists when it comes to smart cities is often Singapore. Since launching its Smart Nation initiative in 2014, Singapore has introduced a wide range of smart technologies in both its public and private sectors. Contactless payment technology has been widely adopted to efficiently direct movement and payments for Singapore’s 7.5 million passengers who use public transports. To help elevate the pressure of an ageing population, a digital health system was introduced – normalising video consultations at the same time – as well as wearable Internet of Things devices to monitor patients. What’s more, Singapore announced in 2021 its plans for a new eco-smart city that is entirely vehicle-free. To be located in Tengah in the western region of Singapore, the planned forest city will be home to five residential districts with 42,000 houses, as well as safe zones for both pedestrians and cyclists.

		<h2>New York</h2>
		<p>
			Hundreds of smart sensors and technologies have been tested and placed through the different districts in New York City as part of its smart city pilot programme in 2020. The programme amasses data to help manage services like waste management and collection more efficiently. New York has also seen the introduction of smart hubs with contactless technology, WiFi capabilities as well as online charging stations in place of phone booths. Car sharing services are also huge in the Big Apple, which helps reduce total emissions and traffic congestions. As an attempt to culminate more local perspectives and creativity, New York City holds an annual contest – with a generous cash prize – for apps that best utilise the city’s open data sets.
